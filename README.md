# whatsup

whatsup is a collection of scripts that can listen to and detect changes to system variables, and perform actions based on them. It's basically an overpowered version of IFTTT for your Linux machine.

## Layout

The simple idea is this: A watcher program sits in the background, listening to events with either scripts called fetchers or by hooking onto events on the ACPI/system level. 

A configuration file is defined based on a bunch of rules, which specify conditions to fulfill in order to run scripts. Sort of just to make it really really interoperable with the shell.
